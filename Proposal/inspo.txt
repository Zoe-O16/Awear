>Textile exchange<

Textile Exchangeâ€™s guidance focuses on step three, how to set appropriate targets. 
By entering into this process, brands will be asked to consider the following: 
what are the main materials used by the organisation? 
Where and how are these materials grown or produced? 
What regions or ecosystems does production rely on for materials? 
What are the highest impacts on nature in these sourcing geographies? 
Is there a relevant certification standard, and how does it address relevant biodiversity risks? 
Does this align with brand expectations and sourcing policies?
